# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Ananda Das 😎

Welcome to my GitHub playground! I'm a developer who loves to code, debug, and occasionally break things (but mostly fix them). If you hear a loud "Eureka!" followed by a *facepalm*, that's probably me realizing I forgot a semicolon... again.

## 🚀 About Me

- **💻 Code Whisperer**: I speak fluent Python, JavaScript.
- **🛠 Bug Hunter**: If there's a bug, I'll find it. Probably because I created it in the first place.
- **☕ Coffee Enthusiast**: My code runs on coffee. Without it, I'd just be a collection of `undefined` variables.
- **🤓 Stack Overflow Searcher**: When in doubt, I consult the oracle (aka Stack Overflow).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a bit of everything else that Stack Overflow suggests.
- **Frameworks**: React, Django, Node — anything that sounds cool and makes me look smarter than I really am.
- **Version Control**: Git — because losing code to the abyss is not fun.
- **Text Editor**: VSCode with so many extensions that it’s more of a life partner than a tool.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- I once wrote a "Hello World" program that crashed my computer. It's a talent.
- I believe in the philosophy: "If it works, don't touch it. If it doesn’t work, still don’t touch it."
- My favorite debugging method is `console.log("Why isn't this working?")`.
